        select studentId from campus_housing where
            dormitoryName = 'akbar's house';
            //use an escape character to use the single quotes
            dormitoryName = 'akbar\'s house';

            //sometimes
                the escape character for 
                    SINGLE QUOTE is 
                    ANOTHER 
                    single quote!

    NULL:
        campus_housing has two columns that allow NULL.
        definition: value does not exist, 
            doesNotMean: false, "", or zero
        ANY column can have NULL
            -provided there is not a constraint
        
        question:"find students where the dorm name is NULL"
            //wrong, NULL does not '=' a value, so we cannot check with '='
            query:"select studentId from campus_housing where dormitoryName = NULL;"
            //correct
            select studentId from campus_housing where dormitoryname IS null
            //key 'IS' word

        question:"find students where dormitoryname is not NULL
        queries:[
            {
                query:"select studentId from campus_housing where dormitoryname IS NOT NULL;",
                desc:"this is how to check if something IS NOT equal to NULL"
